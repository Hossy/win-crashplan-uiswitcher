UISwitcher 1.0 by Hossy

INSTALLATION
############
Extract the contents of the 7z file directly to your CrashPlan install directory.
For example: C:\Program Files\CrashPlan
Files:
.\CrashPlan (Local).lnk
.\CrashPlan (My PC).lnk
.\CrashPlan (SSH Tunnel).lnk
.\UISwapper.bat
.\conf\ui.properties.local
.\conf\ui.properties.mypc
.\conf\ui.properties.sshtunnel

There are three example shortcuts created:
CrashPlan (Local): This launches CrashPlan to manage your local instance.
CrashPlan (My PC): This launches CrashPlan to manage a computer named MYPC (see
more info about direct connecting below).
CrashPlan (SSH Tunnel): This launches a PuTTY session named "Putty Session Name
Here" then launches CrashPlan and connects through that tunnel (see more info about
SSH Tunnel below).


ENABLING REMOTE MANAGEMENT OF CRASHPLAN
#######################################
By default, CrashPlan locks itself down to only be managed locally.  This can be
changed by editing the my.service.xml file.  This must be done on every machine you
intend to manage remotely.
WARNING: Doing this will cause CrashPlan to accept remote connections from
anywhere.  Be sure you understand what this means.  It is HIGHLY recommended that
you enable the option to require a password for the desktop application. To do
this:
1. Open CrashPlan.
2. Click Settings.
3. Choose the Security tab.
4. Check the box for "Require account password to access CrashPlan desktop
application" if it isn't already checked.
5. Click Save.

On Windows 7, the my.service.xml file is located at:
C:\ProgramData\CrashPlan\conf\my.service.xml

1. Stop the CrashPlan Backup Service under Services.
You can also do this by running: net stop CrashPlanService
2. Create a backup copy of your my.service.xml file.
3. Open the my.service.xml file and locate the line:
<serviceHost>127.0.0.1</serviceHost>
It should be under the <serviceUIConfig> section.
4. Change 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0.
	Old line: <serviceHost>127.0.0.1</serviceHost>
	New line: <serviceHost>0.0.0.0</serviceHost>
5. Save the file.
6. Start the CrashPlan Backup Service.
You can also do this by running: net start CrashPlanService

That's it.  Remote Management is now enabled.  Now, let's actually use it.


DIRECT CONNECTING
#################
CrashPlan uses the conf\ui.properties file to determine where it should connect.
UISwapper.bat switches out the ui.properties file to redirect CrashPlan to another
computer.
NOTE: The ui.properties file does not affect your CrashPlan Tray icon.  That will
always display information for your local instance.

Use .\conf\ui.properties.mypc as a template for direct connections:
1. Open ui.properties.mypc in a text editor like Notepad.
Notice the only uncommented (lines not beginning with #) is line 2:
serviceHost=MYPC
This instructs CrashPlan to lookup the IP for MYPC and connect to that computer.
2. Change "MYPC" in line 2 to the name or IP address of the remote computer.
3. Save the file with a new name in the format ui.properties.<identifier> (without
the angle brackets).

Use .\CrashPlan (My PC).lnk as a shortcut template for direct connections:
1. Create a copy of the shortcut.
2. Right-click the copy and choose Properties.
3. In the Target field on the Shortcut tab, change "mypc" to be the <identifier>
you chose above.
4. Click the General tab and rename your shortcut as needed.
5. Click OK.

You're done.  Double-click your shortcut and manage your remote CrashPlan instance.


CONNECTING THROUGH AN SSH TUNNEL

Use the references above to create your PuTTY SSH Tunnel saved session.  You will
need the saved session name and the local port you chose.  CrashPlan's
documentation uses local port 4200.

Use .\conf\ui.properties.sshtunnel as a template for SSH tunnel connections:
1. Open ui.properties.sshtunnel in a text editor like Notepad.
Notice the only uncommented (lines not beginning with #) is line 3:
servicePort=4200
This instructs CrashPlan to use local port 4200 to connect to the CrashPlan Backup
Service.
2. Change "4200" in line 3 to the local port you specified in your SSH Tunnel
config.
3. Save the file with a new name in the format ui.properties.<identifier> (without
the angle brackets).

Use .\CrashPlan (SSH Tunnel).lnk as a shortcut template for direct connections:
1. Create a copy of the shortcut.
2. Right-click the copy and choose Properties.
3. In the Target field on the Shortcut tab:
3a. Change "sshtunnel" to be the <identifier> you chose above.
3b. Change "Putty Session Name Here" to your PuTTY saved session (leave the
double-quotes there).
4. Click the General tab and rename your shortcut as needed.
5. Click OK.

You're done.  Double-click your shortcut, establish your SSH tunnel when prompted,
and manage your remote CrashPlan instance.
